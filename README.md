Instead of usual boring vulture masks, this mod makes them more individualized.

New individualized masks consist of multiple parts: eye cutouts, lower mask, forehead, horns, side horns. (Paint is not yet done.)

The ID of vulture and/or mask entity determines the pieces of which the new mask will consist of.

The mod then chooses the pieces and bakes them into a texture, 9 times for each rotation.

This also works for king vulture masks, but not for elite scavengers or scavenger king.

TODO:
- split the code by modules
- stop the debugging output of textures into streamingassets
- custom scavenger paint maybe someday idk
